# Workbench

First and foremost, you need a place to perform your work. Depending on your needs this might be a small section on your desk, or you may need an entirely seperate workbench. When it comes to choosing a workbench, you'll quickly find that you can spend a _lot_ of money on a high end standing desk, especially if you're looking for a larger one. One place you might consider looking is Home Depot / Lowes, I am a big fan of their Husky standing workbench and am currently using two of them in my office. 

If you're looking for something more traditional, I also have built a handful of workbench setups using IKEA tabletops and legs, this is a very popular option for workstations.

**Note:** The IKEA drawer units have mounting holes on top of them for attaching to IKEA tabletops which makes assembly extremely simple, and you get the added benefit of extra storage. 

## ESD Protections

The last thing that you want to happen is for you to accidentally destroy a device with static electricity, In order to avoid this, it is always a good idea to get an ESD wrist strap or an ESD protective mat. 

**Note:** Not all silicone mats that you will find on Amazon are actually anti-static, please make sure that you read the description of the mat that you are going to purchase if ESD protection is a high priority for your workspace (which it should be!)
