# [Conclusion](./conclusion)

This write-up covered some of the tools required to build your first hardware hacking toolkit. This by no means is an exhaustive list, and I'm sure there are plenty of alternatives to the devices I've listed here (in fact, if you have one that you'd like listed here that I forgot, please shoot me a pull request!).Also, it should be noted that you don't need **all** of these tools to start hacking on hardware. Sometimes it makes more sense to buy what you need for a given project and save money for nicer equipment later on. I hope this guide was helpful; I plan to revisit this writeup regularly to update it with new tools. If you think a tool should be added to this guide, feel free to email at contact@voidstarsec.com or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wrongbaud). A list of just the components discussed here can be found on this [github repository](https://github.com/voidstarsec/hw-hacking-lab), and all pull requests are welcome!
